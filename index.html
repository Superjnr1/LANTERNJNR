    <p>The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season featured the most named storms of any hurricane season at the time. During the 1990 season, 14 tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean became named storms. The season officially started on June 1, 1990, and ended on November 30. However, storm formation is possible at any time of the year, as was the case in this season, when Tropical Depression One formed on May 24; Hurricane Nana, the season's final storm, dissipated on October 21. The season produced 16 tropical depressions, of which 14 intensified into tropical storms, 8 became hurricanes, and 1 became a major hurricane. Although the season had the highest number of named storms at the time, it featured only two notable storms, primarily because many of the tropical cyclones remained either weak or at sea. The two most significant storms of the season, in terms of damage and loss of life, were Hurricane Diana and Tropical Storm Marco. The strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Gustav.<br><br>The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season featured the most named storms of any hurricane season at the time.
